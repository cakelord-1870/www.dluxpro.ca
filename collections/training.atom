<p>This one day course runs from approximately 10am-5pm. With class Location to be disclosed closer to course date. Email with Course outline is emailed 3 weeks prior to date.</p>
<p>No Model is required. Our trainers have found that with volume training it is more important to focus on proper fan creation and placement. With the use of mannequins students are able to focus more on building their skill instead of worrying about completing a full set on a live model.  This same training method is utilized by the top trainers worldwide. </p>
<p>Students are required to bring their own tweezers and any other essentials they require for classic lashing. Students <strong><span>must</span></strong> also have completed a classic lash extension course and hold a valid <strong>Classic Eyelash Extension </strong>certificate.
