<p data-mce-fragment="1">Clean 11 concentrate is the only lash foam concentrate on the market that can be diluted for body alkaline foam (perfect for professional use) and pH balanced foam (perfect for home use) that removes all makeup from the face and eyes, including waterproof mascara. The foam was initially invented for professional lash and brow artists, but is now available for home use. It can be used daily and is compatible with eyelash extensions.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">- Removes all makeup, including waterproof mascara<br data-mce-fragment="1">- Suitable for eyes and entire face<br data-mce-fragment="1">- Compatible with eyelash extensions<br data-mce-fragment="1">- Produces foam that does not dehydrate lashes and skin<br data-mce-fragment="1">- Contains tea tree oil<br data-mce-fragment="1">- Helps prevent inflammation of the eyelids<br data-mce-fragment="1">- Suitable for professional and home use<br data-mce-fragment="1"> </p>
</div>
<div class="description-tag-trigger" data-mce-fragment="1">HOW IT WORKS</div>
<div class="description-tag-content" data-mce-fragment="1">
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Clean 11 Concentrate is diluted to create a pH balanced foam that removes all makeup without dehydrating skin and lashes. pH is a measure of how acidic something is. Levels range from 1 to 14, with 7 being neutral. pHs below 7 indicate acidity, while a pH above 7 is basic. Human skin is slightly acidic, with a pH of around 5-5.5. To keep the pH of skin and lashes balanced, beauty products should also be slightly acidic. Clean 11 Concentrate makes a foam with the right pH level to rebalance your skin and eyelashes pH.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">The product contains tea tree oil, which helps prevent the tiny oil glands near the base of the eyelashes from becoming clogged, thus avoiding irritation, redness and inflammation of the eyelids (Blepharitis).<br data-mce-fragment="1"> </p>

<div class="description-tag-trigger" data-mce-fragment="1">WHY ADHESIVE SUPERDRY</div>
<div class="description-tag-content" data-mce-fragment="1">
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Adhesive Superdry is a 2-in-1 lash primer/adhesive accelerator that has alcohol content several times lower than typical adhesive accelerator so it does not dehydrate lashes like regular primers do.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">It’s the only primer and adhesive accelerator that's compatible with Dark Matter (and also all other adhesives).<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">- It strips natural lashes from oil and fully opens all lash cuticles without dehydrating natural lashes<br data-mce-fragment="1">- It speeds up adhesive curing time by however much is needed<br data-mce-fragment="1">- It starts bonding adhesive vapours as soon as it comes into contact with lash adhesive so your customers feel less irritation from glue fumes during application.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">NB! Adhesive Superdry does not replace Superbonder, it only starts the fume bonding process that is completed by Superbonder<br data-mce-fragment="1"> </p>
</div>
<div class="description-tag-trigger" data-mce-fragment="1">HOW TO USE</div>
<div class="description-tag-content" data-mce-fragment="1">
<p data-mce-fragment="1">You can either use it in three different ways, depending on how much curing speed you want to add to your lash adhesive:<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">1. Speed up adhesive curing time by a little bit: use as a primer on the natural lashes. NB! A little bit goes a long way so cover lashes only from the top OR the bottom - don’t use as much as regular primers<br data-mce-fragment="1">2. Speed up adhesive curing time more: cover 1-2 mm of the bottom of eyelash extensions while they are still on the glue strip. The same way as you would use a regular glue accelerator<br data-mce-fragment="1">3. To make any lash adhesive cure instantly (0.5-1sec bonding upon contact): combine the two previous methods<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">NB! Adhesive Superdry is highly efficient so re-apply only when you feel that adhesive curing time has slowed down again  <br data-mce-fragment="1"> </p>
</div>
<div class="description-tag-trigger" data-mce-fragment="1">SUMMER</div>
<div class="description-tag-content" data-mce-fragment="1">
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Summers are usually hot &amp; humid so all adhesives cure faster than in the winter. Sometimes adhesive still remains sticky after you’ve placed the lash though. This is where Superdry comes in handy - use it on the natural lashes like a primer. It will gently strip excess sebum (oil) from natural lashes without drying them out like traditional primers/pre-treatment serums do. By gently opening lash cuticles Superdry boosts adhesive curing just enough to prevent it from staying sticky. Yet, adhesive will not cure any faster before it is placed on the natural lash.  <br data-mce-fragment="1"> </p>
</div>
<div class="description-tag-trigger" data-mce-fragment="1">WINTER</div>
<div class="description-tag-content" data-mce-fragment="1">
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Winters are usually colder and drier so adhesives cure slower. Use Superdry to make any lash adhesive (no matter the original curing time) cure in less than 1 sec by applying it onto natural lashes, on the glue strip or both, depending on how much speed you need to add to your adhesive curing.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Use a clean micro brush to apply the product on your client’s lashes. Do not double dip the used micro brush in the product jar to avoid any cross-contamination. Always use a clean micro brush when dipping into the tube.<br data-mce-fragment="1"> </p>

<div class="description-tag-content">
<p>Superbonder does what no other product does: prolongs lash extensions while reducing irritation.<br><br>- Increases lash retention by up to 30%<br>- Low to no fumes<br>- Less eye irritation<br>- Reduces lash brittleness<br>- Quick 3 minute drying process<br>- Works with any adhesive<br>- No need for nanomisting or nebulizing<br>- Suitable for sensitive eyes and all types of lashes, including volume lashes<br>- Works in any humidity and temperature conditions<br>- One bottle is enough for 150-200 treatments/clients<br> </p>
</div>
<div class="description-tag-trigger">HOW IT WORKS</div>
<div class="description-tag-content">
<p>This unique lash retention maximizer pushes humidity out of the adhesive surface, sealing it more efficiently and creating a tighter bond. With Superbonder, lash retention grows by up to 30%. The tighter bond also blocks glue fumes and adds elasticity to the adhesive bonding points. The added elasticity makes the lashes more flexible, less sensitive to touch and less prone to breaking or falling off.<br><br>The reduced fumes make Superbonder a safer product to use for professionals and their clients. Everyone is more protected from the lash glue fumes and clients have reported less irritated eyes.Instead of the usual 24 hour drying time, within 3 minutes of being applied, lash extensions are done. They can even get wet!<br><br>With Superbonder there is no need for the typical curing with water droplets. This step is skipped entirely because Superbonder mixes with cyanoacrylate and does the curing process from within. When a Nanomister or Nebulizer is used, the curing process is done from the outside and humidity stays in the adhesive. This means the surface of the adhesive remains porous, so the bond is weaker and more fumes are released. With Superbonder there is no need for a Nanomister or Nebulizer, but you can still use one if you or your client wishes. Just wait for the 3 minutes so that Superbonder dries.<br> </p>
</div>
<div class="description-tag-trigger">HOW TO USE IT</div>
<div class="description-tag-content">
<p>- Wait 2 minutes after you have attached the last extension of the set<br>- Apply 2 drops onto a microfibre brush (no need to soak)<br>- Wipe adhesive bonding points<br>- Allow to dry for 3 minutes</p>

<p><br>Dark Matter is a fast-setting and oil-resistant lash glue that results in better retention.<br><br>- Works with virtually any humidity and temperature<br>- Bonds in half a second to one second<br>- Minimal fumes<br>- 100% oil proof<br>- One glue dot lasts for up to 5 hours<br>- Stays fresh for 3 months after opening<br>- Allows you to work faster<br>- Suitable for intermediate and advanced lash stylists<br>- Works with all types of lashes and techniques<br>- Contains castor oil<br>- Does not contain carbon black<br> </p>
</div>
<div class="description-tag-trigger">HOW IT WORKS</div>
<div class="description-tag-content">
<p>The purity of the cyanoacrylate used in Dark Matter allows it to work with any humidity and any temperature. Generally, the higher the humidity the longer the glue drop will stay fresh, but tests show Dark Matter works perfectly in humidities varying from 10% to 95%, and the glue is optimized in temperatures that range from 16°C to 39°C (61°F to 102°F).<br><br>While Dark Matter sets very fast, it does not dry out on your lash plate or lose its adhesive capability. One glue dot can be worked with for 1.5–5 hours. This means one bottle of Dark Matter will last from 3 to 10 times more than other adhesives and you will work much more efficiently as you do not need to refresh your glue dot every 30 minutes.<br><br>Dark Matter is sensitive to alcohol, so AVOID all high alcohol content products as they affect retention in a negative way (includes hand sanitizers and regular primers/glue accelerators).<br> </p>

<div class="description-tag-trigger">HOW TO USE IT</div>
<div class="description-tag-content">
<p>- Shake well for 1 minute before first use<br>- Apply a drop of Dark Matter on silicone or <a href="https://www.dluxpro.ca/products/foil-glue-sticker?_pos=1&amp;_sid=354f2bf08&amp;_ss=r&amp;variant=39304855486550">foil</a> (DO NOT use on plastic, paper, tape or jade stone as these react to the adhesive) <a href="https://www.dluxpro.ca/products/foil-glue-sticker?_pos=1&amp;_sid=354f2bf08&amp;_ss=r&amp;variant=39304855486550">Foil can be purchased here</a><br>- Allow to air for 5 minutes<br>- Work from the middle of your glue drop, using a scooping technique to pick up a bubble of adhesive and apply it on the root of the extensions<br>- No need to replace glue dots even when they begin to dry out from the outer edge. Get a fresh dot only when the texture becomes stringy<br>- If you use pinching method/finger roll to create volume fans, do not use hand sanitizers with high alcohol content (opt for alcohol-free hand sanitizer) and do not use regular primers/glue accelerators as their main active ingredient is alcohol.<br>- Use ONLY Ruthie Belle’s Adhesive Superdry as a primer/adhesive accelerator (Superdry works with all other adhesives too).<br><br><u></u></p>

<div class="description-tag-trigger">HOW TO STORE IT</div>
<div class="description-tag-content">
<p>- Shake well for 1 minute before first use<br>- Keep container tightly closed when not in use<br>- Store away from direct sunlight or heat<br>- Keep in a cool place, preferably under 25°C (77°F). Unopened bottles may be kept on the middle shelf of the refrigerator. In these cases, take out 30 minutes before first use and shake well for 2 minutes. Never keep an opened bottle of Dark Matter in the fridge to avoid condensed water from developing and starting the glue’s curing process within the bottle.<br>- If stored correctly, Dark Matter stays fresh for 6 months unopened and for up to 3 months after opening</p>
