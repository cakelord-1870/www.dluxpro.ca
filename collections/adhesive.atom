    <td colspan="2"><div class="description-tag-trigger">WHY DARK MATTER</div>
<div class="description-tag-content">
<p><br>Dark Matter is a fast-setting and oil-resistant lash glue that results in better retention.<br><br>- Works with virtually any humidity and temperature<br>- Bonds in half a second to one second<br>- Minimal fumes<br>- 100% oil proof<br>- One glue dot lasts for up to 5 hours<br>- Stays fresh for 3 months after opening<br>- Allows you to work faster<br>- Suitable for intermediate and advanced lash stylists<br>- Works with all types of lashes and techniques<br>- Contains castor oil<br>- Does not contain carbon black<br> </p>
</div>
<div class="description-tag-trigger">HOW IT WORKS</div>
<div class="description-tag-content">
<p>The purity of the cyanoacrylate used in Dark Matter allows it to work with any humidity and any temperature. Generally, the higher the humidity the longer the glue drop will stay fresh, but tests show Dark Matter works perfectly in humidities varying from 10% to 95%, and the glue is optimized in temperatures that range from 16°C to 39°C (61°F to 102°F).<br><br>While Dark Matter sets very fast, it does not dry out on your lash plate or lose its adhesive capability. One glue dot can be worked with for 1.5–5 hours. This means one bottle of Dark Matter will last from 3 to 10 times more than other adhesives and you will work much more efficiently as you do not need to refresh your glue dot every 30 minutes.<br><br>Dark Matter is sensitive to alcohol, so AVOID all high alcohol content products as they affect retention in a negative way (includes hand sanitizers and regular primers/glue accelerators).<br> </p>
</div>
<div class="description-tag-trigger">HOW TO USE IT</div>
<div class="description-tag-content">
<p>- Shake well for 1 minute before first use<br>- Apply a drop of Dark Matter on silicone or <a href="https://www.dluxpro.ca/products/foil-glue-sticker?_pos=1&amp;_sid=354f2bf08&amp;_ss=r&amp;variant=39304855486550">foil</a> (DO NOT use on plastic, paper, tape or jade stone as these react to the adhesive) <a href="https://www.dluxpro.ca/products/foil-glue-sticker?_pos=1&amp;_sid=354f2bf08&amp;_ss=r&amp;variant=39304855486550">Foil can be purchased here</a><br>- Allow to air for 5 minutes<br>- Work from the middle of your glue drop, using a scooping technique to pick up a bubble of adhesive and apply it on the root of the extensions<br>- No need to replace glue dots even when they begin to dry out from the outer edge. Get a fresh dot only when the texture becomes stringy<br>- If you use pinching method/finger roll to create volume fans, do not use hand sanitizers with high alcohol content (opt for alcohol-free hand sanitizer) and do not use regular primers/glue accelerators as their main active ingredient is alcohol.<br>- Use ONLY Ruthie Belle’s Adhesive Superdry as a primer/adhesive accelerator (Superdry works with all other adhesives too).<br><br><u></u></p>
<p><u><a href="https://www.ruthiebelle.com/en/organic-castor-oil/">Castor oil</a></u> is known for its nourishing properties for skin and hair and for promoting hair growth. Recommend it to your customers to strengthen natural lashes while wearing extensions.<br>For more information, watch Ruthie Belle’s “How to use Dark Matter” video <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgiIuPADAY" target="_blank">here</a></u>.<br>NB! Dark Matter is not compatible with Prolong lash cleanser.<br> </p>
</div>
<div class="description-tag-trigger">HOW TO STORE IT</div>
<div class="description-tag-content">
<p>- Shake well for 1 minute before first use<br>- Keep container tightly closed when not in use<br>- Store away from direct sunlight or heat<br>- Keep in a cool place, preferably under 25°C (77°F). Unopened bottles may be kept on the middle shelf of the refrigerator. In these cases, take out 30 minutes before first use and shake well for 2 minutes. Never keep an opened bottle of Dark Matter in the fridge to avoid condensed water from developing and starting the glue’s curing process within the bottle.<br>- If stored correctly, Dark Matter stays fresh for 6 months unopened and for up to 3 months after opening</p>

<div class="description-tag-trigger">OTHER INFORMATION</div>
<div class="description-tag-content">
<p>Dark Matter is produced only twice a month so that customers always receive fresh glue. You can check the manufacturing date (d/m/y) within the “Ch:…” code found on the bottom of the bottle.<br>Dark Matter is black, but does not contain carbon black. It is produced in the EU with the same high “medical grade” cyanoacrylate used in wound adhesives. Please note that Dark Matter should be used only by experienced lash artists.<br> </p>

<p>Dlux Professionals Anti Allergy Gel is able to absorb and eliminate the hazardous substances in the air that are a result of curing adhesive.  Through a chemical reaction hazardous substances such as Formaldehyde (HCHO) and Acetaldehyde  (possible byproducts from ALL Lash Adhesives exposure to air) are converted to Aldehyde Oxime and Water.  This amazing technology is patented by Dlux Professional in 6 Countries, with even more patents pending. </p>
<p>This Technology is able to protect both clients and technicians from possible harmful fumes. Also deodorizes. </p>
<p><b>Anti Allergy Gel is not guaranteed to assist clients with sensitivity issues or allergies.  Its purpose is to help protect Artists and Clients from air pollutants and to minimize fumes from curing adhesive. </b></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions: </span>Open jar and place near adhesive stone.  Leave open for entire Lash Application procedure. Jar is good for 3 months (approx 300 hours) Once gel has shrunk and dried up it is ready for replacement.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Adhesive Disclaimer: </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>When starting with a new adhesive there is a learning curve. Not all adhesives behave the same and should not be treated the same. Even the most experienced technician will have to learn how to work with any new adhesive they encounter. Retention issues are usually the result of technicians failing to use the product correctly or not using enough. With adhesives of a thinner consistency it is recommended to use more adhesive. A small bead should be seen at the</strong> <strong>bottom of the classic lash.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Please always use a Hygrometer in your lash room to ensure humidity requirements are met. Temperature and humidity will both cause retention issues.</strong> </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>There are ABSOLUTELY NO RETURNS and NO REFUNDS on open adhesive</strong>. </span></p>
